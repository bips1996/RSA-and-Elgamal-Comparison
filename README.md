# RSA-and-Elgamal-Comparison
RSA and Elgamal encryption and decryption is done on files of various sizes (50kb , 100kb etc.) and their encryption time, decryption time, encrypted file size and decrypted file size is compared and graph is plotted.

# How to run ?

## For RSA
In RSA folder you will get rsa.py.Run it with command python rsa.py.On line 12 change the filename for different file like 50kb, 100kb etc.Encryption and Decryption files will be created.

## Elgamal
In Elgamal folder you will get test.py.Run it with command python test.py.On line 8 change the filename for different file like 50kb, 100kb etc.Encryption and Decryption files will be created.

# Remember to import pycrypto libaray.
